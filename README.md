## A Simple Yet Engaging Web Game

Memory Color Match is a fun and challenging web-based game designed to test your visual memory, attention to detail, and speed. It's perfect for a quick brain workout or a fun way to pass the time!



## How to Play

1.  **Observe the Grid:** You'll see a grid of colored squares (e.g., 4x4 or 5x5) displayed for a short period (typically 3-5 seconds).
