- Accent color: A vivid orange (#FFB347), positioned approximately 30 degrees to the left of blue on the color wheel, providing high contrast for interactive elements and important information.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look, suitable for both headlines and body text in this application.
- Simple, minimalist icons representing game options and feedback, such as a timer or scoring elements.
- Clean and centered layout to ensure focus remains on the color grids. The UI should minimize distractions to enhance memory and concentration.
